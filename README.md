# Assist S/360 Assembler for MS-DOS
====================================

This is the assist assembler for MS-DOS which compiles S/360 BAL assembler into object code. It also has its own S/360 instructions emulator. 

Furthermore, it also comes with its own editor. 

This an excellent learning tool for mainframe assembler.
